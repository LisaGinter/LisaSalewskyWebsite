                <p>Hi, my name is Lisa.
                </p>
                     On this page, I share some imformation about me:

                    <h3>about my working student jobs</h3>
                        <p> During my first semester in Uni, I immedeately knew that the theoratically based courses would not be enough for me.
                            While we did have a few hands-on programming lessons and projects strewn throughout the semesters, I needed more.<br>
                            Actual work. Collegues I could talk to. And a project that was more than just a short term activity.<br>
                            So, after my first exams, I applied for a working student job and quickly got accepted at ITS Informationstechnik Service GmbH.
                            Applying at their company turned out to be the best decision I could have made at that time.<br>
                            I had amazing help to get started and really enjoyed working for them. 
                            They quickly realised that the task they hired me for required much more implementation work than previously anticipated, which is why I switched to their development department: Lovion GmbH.<br>
                            There I got to design and build up an internal software for digitalizing processes within the company.
                            This task allowed me to start from scratch by <span class="text-highlight">planning and creating a database model</span>, doing a lot of <span class="text-highlight">requirement engineering</span> and overall gave me some first insights into product owner functions.<br>
                            Furthermore, I got to do lots of implementation, learned <span class="text-highlight">C#</span> and got familiar with <span class="text-highlight">agile structures</span>, working with <span class="text-highlight">Git</span> and documenting my code.

                            <p>
                            During my time at Lovion GmbH, I was allowed to do a job at Uni as well.<br>
                            First, I worked as a student tutor for a coding module which teaches the basics of Java to first year students. <br>
                            But after completing a seminar on explainable AI, I got offered a job at the corresponding chair.
                            There, I was tasked with implementing a <span class="text-highlight">explainability</span> algorithm (also detailed in my Bachelor's thesis) and writing the basis of a user study about explainability. 
                            As a student assistant, I also got several smaller tasks in between to generate visualisations in <span class="text-highlight">LateX</span> or work on the chair homepage.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I continued working for Lovion during that time.<br>
                            However, when I went to Japan to study there for one Semester, I had to pause my contract due to complex taxing issues.<br>
                            After the six months, I decided to switch to the Fraunhofer IML Institute for my last semesters at Uni, because I wanted to experience different employers and working conditions before finishing my studies.
                            At the Fraunhofer, I also get to implement quite a lot while also being allowed a good amount of my working hours to improve my skills.<br>
                            Due to that, I highly increased my abilities in the frontend realm.
                            I worked with <span class="text-highlight">Java</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Spring boot</span>, different database engines (<span class="text-highlight">H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL</span>) and also learned how to work with <span class="text-highlight">Angular</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Typescript</span>.
                            The small team I worked in also allowed for all working students to try different product owner tasks, including scheduling meetings to improve the team's knowledge about domain specific requirements and processes, documenting these information and updating or creating tickets to improve the application accordingly.

                    <h3>about my student years</h3>
                        <p> I Studied Computer Science at TU Dortmund University.
                            The courses included a first basics module about Java and a later expansion on what we learned in a 6 week small project.<br>
                            Later, I also worked with <span class="text-highlight">C++, Haskell</span> and <span class="text-highlight">SQL</span> in different courses.
                            For my Bachelor's thesis, I implemented a website and six explainabiliy algorithms for AI decisions in <span class="text-highlight">Python</span> (see <a href="https://github.com/LisaSalewsky/BA-VisualisierungErklaerbarkeitsverfahrenNN">my gitHub repo</a>).

                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            During my Master studies, I got to work on a home automation software with a project group (and we won the <a href="https://alumni-informatik-dortmund.de/node/4731"> alumni price</a>).
                            You can also <a href="./directory/yourfile.pdf" download="newfilename">Download our final report pdf</a>.<br>
                            For this project, we worked as a team of 10 people on creating a frontend visualisation of a "floor plan" to enable the user to visually recreate their own home automation systems, the backend saving and communication management for this plan and all devices and a LTL implementation for a DSL to enable static and runtime checking of user defined constraints.
                            The main topic focused on usability of our program.
                            So, we decided to implement a DSL for creating constraints on their devices, which would be easy to understand for users.
                            The constraints can be used to whatever the user wants. 
                            One example can be to check whether in the user configuration a heater is turned on while a window in the same room is open.
                            If this situation happens, a notification will warn the user that a constraint was violated and which devices are causing this problem.
                            To make the whole application as user friendly as possible, we also implemented a notification service as well as an overview over all devices and all implemented constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            After that, I got to study abroad in Japan at Kyoto University, where I also improved my Japanese.
                            In Japan, I enrolled in a course discussing and presenting recent research topics of the University's groups and chairs, which was really interesting to me. 
                            The class got to try out different research parts and we were taught the basics of 14 different research projects.<br>
                            Additionally, I was able to do a course focusing on the corporation of the faculty of biology and the faculty of Computer Science where I learned a lot about data analysis and how important specialized knowledge of the specific topic is for this task.<br>
                            The third course was a seminar, focussing on recent research topics in detail. 
                            I got to learn about four different theoretical research areas of the University and its partners.<br>
                            The fourth and last Computer Science focused course I participated in concentrated on speech processing, fourier transformations and AI usage of these.<br>
                            Lastly 
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            My Master's thesis encompassed building a full stack solution.
                            I designed a database model and implemented import scripts for city networks taken from open street map, which were combined with additional information like elevation data.
                            For the backend, I implemented two routing metaheuristics and fully re-designed the frontend (see <a href="https://github.com/LisaSalewsky/MA-Customizable-Roundtrips-with-Tour4Me">my gitHub repo</a>).
