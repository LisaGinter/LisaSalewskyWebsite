                    <p> I Studied Computer Science at TU Dortmund University.
                        There, I finished both my Bachelor's and my Master's degree. 
                        You can read more about my education <a href="./work.html">here</a>.

                        <br>
                        During my first semester, I knew I needed more than only theoretical knowledge, so I started working as a working student.
                        My first employer - ITS Informationstechnik Service GmbH and Lovion GmbH - offered me a lot.
                        I got to experience working in a team, planning, designing and implementing software and overall lerning not only about coding but also abput project management.
                        Later, for the last two years of my student years, I started working for the Fraunhofer IML Institute, again as a working student.
                        There, I got to learn about the different structures and policies in a government funded insitute vs a company.
                        In both jobs, I was able to do some project management tasks, got to do a lot of implementing and was able to learn at lot!

                <p> Aside from my education and work experience, there's a lot more to know about me!
                    I love Japan and had the amazing opportunity to travel the country for 6 months after my Abitur and then study abroad for a semester during my master's studies.
                    Through living in Japan, I got to improve my Japanese skills, but I also learned so much more about the country, the culture and - most importantly - I met so many great people!
                    My first stay inspired me to pick Japanese studies as my minor subject during my Bachelor's studies.
                    
                
                    <br>

                    I also really enjoy sewing.
                    What first got me into this huge hobby was Cosplay - a form of costume making and dressing up as characters from a series, book, movie or game.
                    Starting with small and easy costumes, I quickly learned more and more advanced techniques and reached a level where I can confidently sew daily clothes for myself.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Finally, the third interest that grew with me over many years is dancing.
                    More than 10 years ago, I started a small private dance group with a few friends of mine.
                    First, we practiced in the basement of our homes, in our rooms, in different parks and just wherever possible.
                    But a few years later, we started saving up and organized a room at a local kindergarden and AWO venue, bought large practice mirrors and got them installed.
                    So, we finally had a place for practice. 
                    From there, we mostly danced and practiced for ourselves, but we also had a few performances and entered two contests.
